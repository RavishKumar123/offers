# Information Regarding 3rd Party Apis used in Project:

1. Redux Toolkit (@reduxjs/toolkit)
    I have used Redux Toolkit because it aims to speed up Redux development by including Redux Core with the packages that they think are essential to build a Redux app. It is an opinionated derivative of Redux, with many best practice configurations for developers who want simple, fast and clean Redux code.

3. Enzymes
   I have used it to write automated end to end tests, since we are using react version 17 the official enzyme adapter for react version 17 is not still released thats'y i have used 3rd party @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17 adapter to configure enzyme in our project.

4. Axios
   I have used axios to call api's instead of default fetch() api because of many reasons including Axios has wide browser support and it performs automatic transforms of JSON data.

4. React-Bootstrap 
   I have used it becaause it provides us classes that help us build Responsive UI and also it contains premade classes of almost all css properties.

5. node-sass
   I have used it to make our application support and run .scss files.


# Note:
  If you get Network error after running application then kindly check that Cors are enabled on the server side you are calling.
